# OGXC On Screen Keyboard  

On screen keyboard for the ogxc app. Written as a modular library. 

## Dependencies
OGXC-TTF library - for text rendering on the screen

## Customization Notes

Can change the skin / UI colours by replacing `bg.jpg`. Keep the same drawing area for text string (top) and keyboard layout (bottom), as these are drawn on by the app.

Design files (GIMP) for the background can be found in the top level graphics folder of OGX-Cloud.
